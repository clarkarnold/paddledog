	                           <p>I was using a typical fitness tracker to record our paddle outings, but 
	                           I wanted a more tailored logger for my records. I decided to code this up for 
	                           fun as well as to learn. It is all open source and you can find the code on 
	                           <a href="https://github.com/clarkarnold/paddledog" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
